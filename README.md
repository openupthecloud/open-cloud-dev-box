# Open Cloud Dev Box

Open Cloud Dev Box is a project that makes learning cloud faster, easier and safer. By having a preconfigured, isolated development environment based in a container, and compatible with various cloud-based development environment services like [Gitpod](http://gitpod.io/) + Codespaces you're safe to explore, play and learn the cloud without worrying about breaking your machine. Additionally, configurations include security best practices and standards.

## Motivations

1. No more wasted time setting up your environment
2. No more broken environments (isolated environment)
3. Secure, by default (best practice security)
4. Extensible and personalisable

## Getting Started

## Getting Started

### With Gitpod

1. Create Gitpod account. 
2. [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#github.com/openupthecloud/open-cloud-dev-box) (Or click: [gitpod.io/#https://github.com/openupthecloud/open-cloud-dev-box](https://github.com/openupthecloud/open-cloud-dev-box))
3. Type `aws` (or any other supported CLI or tool) into the terminal to verify

### With Codespaces

1. Create a GitHub account
2. Go to: github.com/codespaces and start a new Codespace based on the project
3. Type `aws` (or any other supported CLI or tool) into the terminal to verify

### Locally

Coming soon! 

## Compatibilities

Open Cloud Dev Box is intended to be configured to work across platform / standards:

1. [devcontainer.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
2. [.gitpod.yml](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/gitpod-yml)
3. [devfile](https://devfile.io)
4. [Score Dev](https://score.dev)

Allowing you to make use of both cloud-based development environments + local running container-based environments.
